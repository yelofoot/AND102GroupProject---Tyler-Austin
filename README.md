## Overview

### Description  
LocalLens is a mobile app that delivers daily location-based photo challenges, encouraging users to explore their city and capture creative photos. Users complete a challenge by taking a picture within a specified area, then view all submitted photos displayed on an interactive map. LocalLens blends creativity, travel, and social discovery into a uniquely mobile experience.

### App Evaluation

- **Story:** Encourages users to explore their nearby environment, complete fun photo challenges, and discover creative submissions from others. Easy to understand and engaging.  
- **Market:** Appeals to travelers, college students, local explorers, creatives. Large potential user base with a fun niche.  
- **Habit:** Daily photo challenges plus a map of community submissions encourage frequent engagement and returning use.  
- **Scope:** MVP is very achievable: daily challenge prompt → photo capture & submission → map of results. Optional gamification features can scale later.
